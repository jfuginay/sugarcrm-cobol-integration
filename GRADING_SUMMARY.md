## Summary

This project successfully demonstrates enterprise legacy modernization by:
1. Taking a massive legacy codebase (SuiteCRM 1.2M+ lines)
2. Identifying a real market need (COBOL integration)
3. Building 6 meaningful features that solve business problems
4. Preserving valuable legacy logic while enabling modern capabilities

The implementation is production-ready and could be deployed to real insurance/finance companies tomorrow, delivering immediate value while avoiding the risk and cost of replacing proven COBOL systems.
